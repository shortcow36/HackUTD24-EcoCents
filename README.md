EcoCents: Smarter Insights for Sustainable Savings.
Track energy usage, water usage, and carbon emissions. Receive an accurate visual of costs over time, and get suggestions to minimize costs.

## Inspiration
Global warming is a very pressing issue of today, and the increasing amounts of energy consumption, water usage, and carbon emissions are direct contributors to it. However, most people cannot easily and accurately track their carbon footprint/cost of energy. The prompts from CBRE and Veolia gave us the opportunity create a tool for property managers to track these outputs in their buildings, and identify and eliminate the problems that would otherwise go unnoticed or unsolved.

## What it does
Consolidates tools to monitor, control, and analyze the energy consumption and cost over time for building managers.

## How we built it
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Firebase, Figma

## Challenges we ran into
Firebase API: we struggled to successfully integrate user auth with pre-existing frontend.
Tools: We attempted to build this project using React, but it would not build, so we had to use the more basic tools. We also had to learn to implement and translate Figma Dev Mode.
Features: Building an accurate graph of energy/water usage and costs.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have graphs that successfully implement user input and JSON data to calculate and track the necessary spending. The routing and aesthetics of the project turned out close to the way we wanted it, and we managed to learn and implement new tech stacks as we went.

## What we learned
We learned how to implement user auth with Firebase, integrating frontend and backend (full-stack), and how to adapt when things do not go according to plan.

## What's next for EcoCents
Our stretch goals include integrating an AI chatbot to give suggestions on reducing energy usage/carbon footprint, add more to the UI/UX (animations, more visuals, etc.)
